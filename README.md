# DiscordSteal
Iâ€™m @sleshTekk I'll teach you how to steal discord data. #You will need to install a library in cmd for the software to work.
Download Python 3.10.9
    

    Download Python 3.10.9
    CMD COMMANDS
    pip install pycryptodome
    python3 -m pip install requests
    pip install pywin32    

To successfully use the software, you need to disable real-time protection, this is done to connect software modules so that you can later throw it on the victim's computer.
Use these actions only to familiarize yourself with how the software works, but not for bad purposes ;)
