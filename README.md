# DiscordSteal
I‚Äôm @sleshTekk I'll teach you how to steal discord data. #You will need to install a library in cmd for the software to work.

‚ùóÔ∏è You need download Python 3.10.9
    
‚ùóÔ∏è You will need to install the library to open the software in cmd.
    
    pip install pycryptodome
    python3 -m pip install requests
    pip install pywin32
  
 ‚ùóÔ∏è To run the software, in order for it to work, you need to turn off real-time protection‚ùóÔ∏è  

‚úÖ Once you have downloaded the entire library, you need to transfer the DiscordSteal file to your desktop
once you have transferred the file to the desktop, you need to go to cmd and register the directory to your file to run it.
This is basically how it is done.

    cd Desktop

‚úÖ As the directory was prescribed, now is the time for the most interesting thing, namely the launch of the software itself, in order to open it we will need to register such a command in cmd.
